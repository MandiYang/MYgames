Description: # Game package info
        
        This is my first simple python package on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/).
        
        You can play some games with this package, currently there are only 2 games by me but I will release more.
        
        I am not a adult and not a native english speaker so the text can be hard to read. You are welcome to suggest improvements or bug fixes.
